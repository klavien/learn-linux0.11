nothing else I just want to learn the source code of linux 0.11!

I use centos in my machine, and I use gcc8.3 to compile the linux kernel.

to fix some complie error,I replace as86 and ld86 by dev86, and use as and ld.

there are some compile error now, I just want to fix it and hope it can run finally,
I will annotate the kernel source code it needed.
